**Background:**
- I've never had a personal website. I sit on domains that I don't use. I am thinking of redirecting my real name domains to lowyelling.com, which is my username across every site you can think of (Twitter, Github, Discord, Substack, Instagram). Lowyelling is an Englishified pun on my real legal name. I also want to keep lowyelling.com because it is a dot com, better for SEO, and also because I want to maintain some anonymity. I don't mind if IRL people find me first and then redirect from my name to my website, but I do mind my privacy just generally online. 

**Decisions:**
- Strategic
	- This will be my main landing page professionally, as well as an art and writing and dev project portfolio, as well as a blog. I write on Substack as lowyelling under the publication Furniture Coins, which I aim to be more like true essays and not blogs, though perhaps I will essay-ify some of the blogs, or post a monthly essay with links to all my key blog posts, something like that
	- I am learning to become a new type of junior software dev, the "junior senior engineer" at Fractal Tech, and this is one of the first projects
- Practical
	- Static site 
	- Host on Github Pages for now, no issue. If I expand into fancy frameworks like Next.js, then I can migrate to Netlify (used before) or Vercel. Ghost is far too early to use/I don't have problems that need to be solved with Ghost right now. 
	- Use the privacy layer with .com SEO value, with memorable pun, and use redirecting from my real name domains to lowyelling.com
